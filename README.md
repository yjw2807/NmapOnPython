# NmapOnPython

Originally part of a project and i change my mind

so :)

For future maybe i can find this code here?

Anyway a simple code

maybe you first option search from ai is faster

but if u see this code snipt

then u have a template let ai change :)

Kindly Reminder: remember to add the path of nmap (if you download zenmap it should have a choice to let u tick if i didnt remember wrongly, anyway u also can ask ai to check the errors :) )
